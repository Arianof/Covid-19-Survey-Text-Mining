# Covid-19-Survey-Text-Mining
"This NLP project aimed to analyze a comprehensive collection of survey articles. We employed text preprocessing techniques, including stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal, to prepare the data for clustering and topic modeling. We utilized K-means clustering to group similar articles and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
